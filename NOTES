Possible performance improvements
=================================

* Improved representation of C++ objects in Lua
    - LTObjects should be represented directly as userdata in lua.
      (I.e. no wrapper Lua table)
    - Use the environment table of the userdata for custom fields and
      to mirror references to other objects (so Lua GC knows about them)
    - Use placement new C++ operator to initialize objects.
    - Call C++ object descructor using __gc metatable method.
    - Rename lua_wrap to lua_ud and have it be a weak reference to the
      Lua userdata value.  Would there be a more efficient way to do this?

* All tweens should be native
    - Make tweening completely native.  Tweens on an object can be
      removed in the destructor.

* gperf for field lookup
    - Create a perfect hash function for all possible fields of native objects.
      Use this to map strings to an enumeration of the possible fields.
      Switch on this enumeration in get_field/set_field/field_ptr functions.
