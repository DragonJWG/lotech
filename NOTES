Possible performance improvements
=================================

* Improved representation of C++ objects in Lua
    - LTObjects should be represented directly as userdata in lua.
      (I.e. no wrapper Lua table)
    - Use the environment table of the userdata for custom fields and
      to mirror references to other objects (so Lua GC knows about them)
    - Use placement new C++ operator to initialize objects.
      Alternatively require LTObjects to implement an init method.
    - Call C++ object descructor using __gc metatable method.
      Alternatively require LTObjects to implement a destruct method.
    - Delete the lua_wrap field of LTObject.  Instead use a lightuserdata
      constructed from the object pointer as a key in a weak valued table.
      The values of this table are the full userdatas.
    - Use something more efficient than lt.wrefs to get the weak references
      table.  Maybe a special index in the registry.
    - Instead of using a weak references table consider using the LTObject
      pointer to push a new userdata lua value.  I think this should be okay,
      because I think the pointers to the metatable and env table are not part
      of the lua value struct, but reside inside the block allocated for the
      userdata.

* All tweens should be native
    - Make tweening completely native.  Tweens on an object can be
      removed in the destructor.

* gperf for field lookup
    - Create a perfect hash function for all possible fields of native objects.
      Use this to map strings to an enumeration of the possible fields.
      Switch on this enumeration in get_field/set_field/field_ptr functions.

Commercialization roadmap
=========================

* Ability to run lua commands from lotech console.
* Ability to refresh assets without restarting app.
* Reload only changed assets on restart (for faster restart when many assets).
* Particle effects (using point sprites).
* BG music playback (ogg or using native APIs).
* Manual + tutorial.
* Ability to record session and replay.  Automated testing?
* Allow multiple devices to connect to multiple PCs over the same LAN.
* Detect infinite loops in scene graph if in dev mode.
* Better progress feedback in console when transferring large files.
* Keep md5 checksums of files and only transfer when changed.
* Improve ui button controls. i.e. gracefully cancel buttons if they
  become invisible. 
* Maybe add other widget such as sliders and coverflow-style albums.
* Add scrollable areas.

Commercialization plan
======================

* Launch at least 2 titles on app store.
* Make video showing features.
* Send to companies and ask about presenting and/or offer to develop POC:
    - Millipede
    - Nextstudio?
    - WSP Digital (Damien, Evan)
    - Jon's company (Michael Beach)
