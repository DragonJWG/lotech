# Lotech

A game framework designed by and for Ian MacLarty,
suitable for small-scope games and experimentation.

Runs on Linux, Windows (MinGW) and Mac OS X.

Some features:

    - Lua-based
    - Rendering via scene graph
    - Automatic sprite atlas generation
    - Render-to-texture
    - Basic lighting and material support
    - Limited support for importing wavefront .obj files
    - 2D particle effects
    - Box2D integration

# Building

On Linux, first install glew, glfw, openal and opengl libraries and headers.

On Windows, install MinGW and MSYS.  Also install OpenAL (available here:
http://connect.creativelabs.com/developer/Wiki/OpenAL%20Installer%20for%20Windows.aspx).

On Mac OS X install the Apple dev tools and ensure gcc is in your PATH.

Then do:
    
    make

This will generate the executable ltclient, which you can use to run
games.  E.g:

    ./ltclient -fullscreen samples/meteor
